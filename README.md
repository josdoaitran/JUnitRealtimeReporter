## Install and setup realtime report

+ Install a docker to our desktop. (Windows, Ubuntu, Macosx)
* Alternate solution: we can create a Virtual machine - VM on VMWare or Oracle Virtual Box and install UBUNTU operation.

To assure that docker was installed on our server by using this command:

```
root@ubuntu:~# docker -v
Docker version 18.06.0-ce, build 0ffa825
```




+ Add more dependencies to pom file
